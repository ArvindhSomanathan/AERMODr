Low-level interface to AERMOD for R


**AERMOD** is a steady-state plume model that incorporates air dispersion based on planetary boundary layer turbulence structure and scaling concepts, including treatment of both surface and elevated sources, and both simple and complex terrain.  http://www.epa.gov/ttn/scram/dispersion_prefrec.htm#aermod

AERMOD is U.S. EPA's preferred air dispersion model. The purpose of this package is to provide a fairly straight-forward interface for performing AERMOD runs from R.
